        <h2></h2>
         <div class="homepage-content text-left"><p>Over the past decade Healthcare has emerged as the most highly targeted industry by threat actors.  The combination of rapid threat evolution, monetization of stolen health information, and organizational complexities have created a perfect storm of opportunity for them and risk for healthcare organizations around the world.  This risk has created inherent challenges in how we respond to these threats that require more thought and consideration than other critical infrastructure industries.</p>
<p>California is home to a wide range of healthcare and healthcare related organizations that combined support the needs of 40 million consumers.  The key challenge associated with safeguarding the data and services this population relies on is implementing effective cyber security program and capabilities.  These capabilities and programs must ensure that information is available when needed, always protected (including supporting information systems) from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.</p>
<p>Common challenges facing healthcare cybersecurity groups today include a lack of qualified and skilled cybersecurity professionals, a shortage of operational frameworks and models, maintaining a balance between security and services, and the need for consistent processes and procedures to support cybersecurity operations.</p>
<p>The California Healthcare Cybersecurity Workgroup (CHCW) has been formed to provide a community of healthcare industry peer cybersecurity practitioners and partners to have a forum to share ideas, best practices, and resources toward our common goal of better protecting and safeguarding the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the people, communities, and organizations we serve.</p>
<h3 id="mission">MISSION</h3>
<p>We are a community of healthcare cybersecurity professionals and practitioners dedicated to the common goal of protecting the data and systems our organizations rely on daily to provide the care and services our communities rely on by the sharing of ideas, challenges, practices, and knowledge.</p>
